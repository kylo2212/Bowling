# Bowling
Midterm project for Java class

A console program created to take the scores input for a game of bowling and calculates the score. The scoreboard is also shown to the players. (I still need to fix a few things in this program.) This is the untouched code since I turned it in for a grade. To finish debugging and improving this is a future task sometime.
